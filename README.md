# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my Github.

## My workflow

I used only one framework and that was of course my favorite **Tailwind**. For this challenge i was focus on semantic **HTML** i also tried to implement this with accesibility features so users can navigate with keyboard. For **Javascript** part it was straight forward i used event delegation for event handlers so i didn't needed to create events for every single element.
